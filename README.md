## Project Summary

I built a Power BI Dashboard to analyze product returns across 3 years (2014â€“2016).
The goal was to identify return trends, employee contribution, and business impact.

### Key Insights

Return Growth: +57% overall (2015: +7.44%, 2016: +0.93%).

Return Counts: 366 total (2014: 106, 2015: +16, 2016: +34).

Sales Trend: 2014 â€“ 484K, 2015 â€“ 471K, 2016 â€“ 609K.

Drivers: High returns from South region, Home Office customers, and Furniture & Technology categories.

Profit Impact: 106K in returns (~7% of sales) cutting into profit.
